## Project Description
WinVerEx is command prompt utility that returns a "fully qualified" version of Windows 10.

## Project Origin
Over the different versions of Windows 10, I couldn't seem to find a way to grab the all of the version information about a current install of the OS.  In the past, you could get some information from ver, some from winver and some from the System page in Settings.  Since things could get confusing in the Insiders Program, I thought it would be good to have an atomic EXE that could be run on the command line and clear up any confustion.

## Where can I get the compiled version?
Click the Releases button in the header above or go to https://github.com/randyrants/winverex/releases directly

## How do I use it?
* Make sure you have the .NET Framework v4.6 installed
* Download the ZIP file
* Put the EXE anywhere you want
* Open a Command Prompt window
* Type winverex

## Hope for GitHub contributions:
* Create an MSI or MSIX installer? (for a 4KB ZIP package it feels icky)
* Continued support for new .NET Frameworks
